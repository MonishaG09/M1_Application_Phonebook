## Introduction
   The phonebook application works specifically for tracking people. The Phonebook application contains a set of basic functions for adding, searching, updating, and deleting new contacts. This mini-C phonebook design allows you to perform simple tasks in your phonebook, such as mobile phones.
## Research
   This application provides information on adding, viewing, modifying, receiving, and deleting data from/to files. When you add anything to your phone book, you will be asked for personal information such as name, gender, blood group, first name, phone number, nationality, email address, and address. You can then edit, view, search, and delete this text.
