     This application provides information on adding, viewing, modifying, receiving, and deleting data from/to files. Adding new entries, browsing them, editing and updating, searching for saved contacts, and deleting contacts in the phonebook is one of the most important services that become the main menu in the phonebook application. When you add anything to your phone book, you will be asked for personal information such as name, gender, first name, phone number, nationality, email address, and address. You can then edit, view, search, and delete this text.
